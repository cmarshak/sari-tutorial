In this tutorial, we concentrate on images from the L-band SAR sensor from [ALOS/PALSAR](https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/alos/). L-band sensors are popular for forest analysis due to their long wavelengths and ability to penetrate canopy cover for additional information. ALOS-1 was a satellite that was active from 2007-2010 that had the L-band PALSAR-1 sensor and ALOS-2 is its successor with the PALSAR-2 sensor. There are numerous other satellite SAR sensors including Sentinel-1 (C-band) and UAVSAR (airborne L-band).\n", "\n", "This list below was made relatively quickly. Hope this gets you started.
